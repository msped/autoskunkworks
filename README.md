## What is AutoSkunkWorks? 
AutoSkunkWorks is a manager for car builds using a user-dynamic, mobile friendly interface. The site allows you to plan build in one place and provide links to the websites to by the parts as well as show the price. Builds can be kept public or changed to private along with the pricing which can be toggled to be viewable or hidden.

This project is a Django version of AutoLog, a more in-depth README can be found [here](https://github.com/msped/autolog).
